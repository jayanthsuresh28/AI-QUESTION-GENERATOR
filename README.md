# AI-QUESTION-GENERATOR
This project uses Natural Language Processing to automatically generate 1-mark, 2-mark and higher-mark exam questions from syllabus PDFs. The system analyzes content, extracts key concepts, and creates exam-oriented questions based on selected marks and difficulty, helping students and teachers save time and improve exam preparation.
